# [Chat Defender Drop-in](https://chatdefender.com/)
# OpenAI API Client Library in Swift

This is a drop-in replacement for the "SwiftOpenAI", as maintained by SwiftBeta
https://github.com/SwiftBeta/SwiftOpenAI

It includes minimal changes to make it compatible with Chat Defender.

[Chat Defender](https://chatdefender.com/) allows you to use the same API, but without exposing your OpenAPI key or prompts.

It also allows you to modify your prompts on the fly.

## Installation üíª

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in the `Package.swift` file or by adding it directly within Xcode.

`.Package(url: "https://github.com/Chat-Defender/SwiftOpenAI.git", majorVersion: 0.7.0)`



## üíª Usage

For the most part, follow the instructions in the original project
https://github.com/SwiftBeta/SwiftOpenAI

Read the documentation at Chat Defender to move your prompts & key to Chat Defender

You can then use the slightly modified API below

### [Streaming Chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

(Non streaming chat is also supported. See the original documentation)

```swift
        let openAI = SwiftOpenAI(apiKey: "CHAT_DEFENDER_TOKEN")
        
        //'substitute_joke' is the key for a message with the prompt "Limit Prose: Please tell me a joke about ##subject##!"
        //'subject' is the subject for your new joke
        
        let messages: [MessageChatGPT] = [
          MessageChatGPT(role: .user,
                         cdContent: CDMessage(key: "substitute_joke",
                                              variables: ["subject" : subject])
                        )
        ]
        
        //Note you must set streaming to true here if you're using createChatCompletionsStream
        let optionalParameters = ChatCompletionsOptionalParameters(stream: true)

        do {
            let stream = try await openAI.createChatCompletionsStream(model: .gpt4(.base), messages: messages, optionalParameters: optionalParameters)
            
            for try await response in stream {
                if let delta = response.choices.first?.delta?.content {
                    //prints next segment
                    print(delta)
                }
            }
        } catch {
            print("Error: \(error)")
        }

```
